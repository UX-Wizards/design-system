      Our palette consists of neutral, pleasing 
tones balanced by vivid and eccentric 
colors. This color palette has been 
carefully chosen to provide versatility and 
function while still providing boundless 
room for expression. The flexible and neutral Magician’s Cloak, 
Merlin’s Beard, and Steel lead the way, providing a well-balanced
foundation. They are accompanied by the livelier colors of Mana,
Acid, Charm, and Elixir. Our brighter colors should be used with
restraintand finesse. We want our designs to stand out, but avoid
being tacky and distasteful.
