          When referring to the group, we use “UX Wizards” for external, public-facing copy.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-4 max-w-prose">
          This may be abbreviated “UXW” in more informal or internal documentation, but should be introduced in parentheses after the full terminology for its first use <span className="italic text-gray-500"> — e.g. &quot; UX Wizards (UXW) is the bee’s knees!&quot;</span>
        </p>
        <p className="pb-4 max-w-prose">
          We may informally refer to ourselves or other members as Wizards.

          Our voice is what remains consistent across all the content we create. It should reflect our values and personality and define us easily.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-4 max-w-prose">
          We focus on people first - in a way where we consider everyone a friend. Our voice is inclusive and inviting, always eager to get our friend to join us in the fun but never to the point of being overbearing.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-4 max-w-prose">
          We respect our friends and above all we want them to do what makes them happy. If they’re not ready to join us, there is no pressure because like a good friend we are always here for them when they’re ready. We are understanding, kind, and patient.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-8 max-w-prose">
          Still, we can be a little teasing. What’s a little fun between friends after all? Jokes and puns let them know we don’t take anything too seriously.

          UX Wizards’ tone of voice is unique to our group and true to our identity at all time, but changes depending on our message. This should guide you in conveying different attitudes.
